      {
        question: "How does the Decorilla process work?",
        answer: "Our process is simple: First, complete a quick style quiz and room survey. Next, we match you with 2-3 designers who create custom concepts for your space.

Finally, you purchase items at your own pace and bring your design to life."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does the design process take?",
        answer: "The typical timeline is 7-10 days for initial concepts and 10-14 days for the final design package. However, timelines can vary based on your responsiveness and the complexity of your project. We work at your pace to ensure you're completely satisfied."
      },
      {
        question: "What information do I need to provide?",
        answer: "You'll need to provide room measurements, photos of your space, information about your style preferences, budget for furnishings, and any specific needs or challenges. The more information you provide, the better we can tailor your design."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I request revisions?",
        answer: "Absolutely! All our packages include revision rounds. You can request changes to layouts, furniture selections, colors, and styling. We work with you until you're completely satisfied with your design."

      },
      {
        question: "Can I use my own furniture?",
